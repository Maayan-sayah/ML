machine learning projects 

Machine learning is a field that deals with the development of algorithms designed to allow the computer to learn from examples, and works in a variety of computational tasks in which classical programming is not possible. 

In this program we solve the problam with 3 algorithm: Preceptorn, passive-agresive anf KNN.
